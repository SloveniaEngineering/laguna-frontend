# Laguna


### Requirements

- Latest version of Flutter installed - [Download][download]
- Flutter added to your environmental:
    - [Windows instructions][windows-environment]
    - [MacOS instructions][macos-environment]
    - [Linux instructions][linux-environment]
- IDE of choice with Flutter/Dart plugins (Android Studio / IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code).
- Google Chrome browser for web builds
- A connected mobile device (Android or iOS)
    - An appropriate emulator works aswell - [Android][android-emulator-guide]


### Preparation

To build or run the application, we must first prepare the project. We do this by running the following commands:

  ```sh
  cd laguna-frontend
  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
  flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  cd ios //required only for iOS/MacOS
  rm -rf Pods/ Podfile.lock //required only for iOS/MacOS
  pod install //required only for iOS/MacOS
  ```

If you want to run backend server locally, clone [laguna-backend][laguna-backend] repository and follow instructions in README.md file.
To run backend server, execute `scripts/dev.sh` script from laguna-backend repository.

### Web App

# Running the Web app
Because of current CORS issues on backend, you have to run web app with `--web-port 4200` parameter. (same as
`FRONTEND_PORT` in `scripts/dev.sh`) so that FE gets whitelisted as origin by CORS.

```sh
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 4200
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 4200 --release //Run release build of web app
```
Possible workarounds for running the web app: `--web-browser-flag "--disable-web-security"`. (**DO NOT USE IN
PRODUCTION**).
## Building an Web app
```sh
flutter build web
flutter build web --release //Build web app for production
```


### Building an Android app (Release APK)

```sh
flutter build apk --split-per-abi //Build app with all architectures - Mostly used for test builds
flutter build appbundle //Build appbundle - Needed for Play Store
```

### Building an iOS/MacOS app

For iOS or MacOS, open the project in Xcode and build & archive the project from there.
More information can be found [here][ios-build-guide]
More information about building MacOS app can be found [here][macos-build-guide]

An alternative is to run the following command in project home directory
```sh
flutter build ipa
```
or for MacOS
```sh
flutter build macos
```
And then open the project in Xcode and archive the project from there.
-- Or using an app like transporter to upload the ipa to App Store Connect

### Building an Windows app - Not yet tested
For more information, see [here][windows-build-guide]
```sh
flutter build windows //Build windows app 
```

### Building an Linux app - Not yet tested
For more information, see [here][linux-build-guide]
```sh
flutter build linux //Build linux app 
```

### Testing

To run tests for the solution, run the following command in project home directory
```sh
flutter test
```

And if you would like code coverage generated
```sh
flutter test --coverage
```
This will generate a `${lcov.info}` file.


### Troubleshooting

If experiencing iOS related build with modules (invalid, missing, not found), see the following link for help [Here][ios-pods-cleaning]
